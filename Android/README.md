The primary purpose of the Android application is to establish a Bluetooth connection with a previously paired Bluetooth-module, then listening for data being sent from the Smart-Wiper Box. As soon as the Bluetooth connection is established with the Smart-Wiper Box, it sends calculated wiper position data to the Android device. 

Note: In order to use the application,  you first need to pair the Smart-Wiper Box to the Android device. This can be done through the main Bluetooth Setting on the Android device.

Once the application is launched, toggle the *Bluetooth* switch and wait until the Bluetooth status says *Bluetooth Opened*. In order to check that a successful bluetooth connection was made, look for a green light on the Smart-Wiper Box. Once all connections are established Wiper Status data shows up in large text on the Android application. 

Note: If the Bluetooth status says *Bluetooth Device Found*, the android device has been paired to the device but a connection was not made.

In order to close the Bluetooth connection, turn off the *Bluetooth* switch. This stops all Bluetooth communication with the box. 

In order to view the logs that were saved, navigate to your device's *Downloads* folder. The data will be stored in a file called *wiper_data.txt*
